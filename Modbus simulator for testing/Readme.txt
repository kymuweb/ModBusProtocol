You must use the local IP: 10.128.1.27 to connect to the simulator.

Notice the 'Address' column in the mod_RSsim is coming with a missing digit, for example, the 
address 40191 will be 400191 in reality. You can check the title of the message box 'Edit 
decimal value at XXXXX'. For the title of the dialog the address is fine.
